Bongani is a Swazi (a citizen of morden-day ESwatini -- a country previously known as Swaziland). He is a curious soul, broadly fascinated with scientific discovery, experimentation, and application. He is an engineer by training, holding a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic) from the University of Swaziland and a Master of Engineering (Electronic) from Stellenbosch University. He is passionate about applying acquired engineering and software-development skills to design robust systems. His interest is in the broad field of robotics and autonomous systems, and particularly in the areas of multi-robot systems, task and motion planning,  reinforcement learning,  adaptive control,  optimisation,  and autonomous vehicles. Lastly, he is a computer science fanatic, and aims to eventually (formally) double up as an engineer and computer scientist, hence his residence at the RAIL Lab.
