I am an aspiring game developer, software engineer, lego connoisseur, aviation enthusiast, factorio addict and every other comp-sci student stereotype under the sun.
The most important one out of all of them however is that I'd like to be a researcher on the indomitable *P* vs. *NP*.

While trying to figure that out, I am working in reinforcement learning, a long held passion started by a patchwork attempt at a NEAT algorithm for my Grade 10 IT project.
A matric and undergrad later, I'm working with best people and lab in South Africa for exactly that field, hoping at least one of them can explain NEAT to me.
