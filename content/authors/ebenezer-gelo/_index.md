My journey has been deeply rooted in a profound passion for gaming. Growing up in Hawassa, Ethiopia, my early exposure to technology ignited a lifelong fascination with the limitless possibilities it holds. My fascination has since evolved into a focused interest in AI (batch reinforcement learning and knowledge transfer)

I believe my passion for AI has shaped me into an advocate for the transformative power it holds and I am excited about the prospect of contributing to advancements in the field, bringing about positive change, and furthering the intersection of technology and society.
