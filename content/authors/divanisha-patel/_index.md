I grew up in Durban. From 2011 to 2014, I studied Actuarial Science at the University of Cape Town, followed by a Masters in Mathematical Finance in 2015. I worked in the banking sector in Johannesburg from 2016 to 2022 as a trading floor quant (building pricing and risk measurement models). In 2020, I joined the RAIL Lab to pursue a part-time PhD in reinforcement learning under the guidance of Professor Benjamin Rosman. In 2022, I transitioned into an AI-focused role to work as an applied AI research engineer for InstaDeep (current role). I am very interested in deploying reinforcement learning in the real-world. I am passionate about knowledge sharing and building the AI community in South Africa. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, running and learning piano.
