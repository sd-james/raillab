I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechatronics Engineering at UCT in 2018. Since then, I've been working in FinTech and MLOps consulting. My responsibilities have ranged from full stack web development, software engineering and cloud solutions to problem solving in the financial and financial risk spaces. I began my Masters degree in Robotics in 2023 and am currently conducting my research in the RAIL Lab, under the supervision of Dr Benjamin Rosman.

**About me** - I love the outdoors and all things creative. I love trail running, hockey and snowboarding; painting, music and DIY... I love to get my hands dirty and believe anything is possible!
