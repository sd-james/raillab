I have two main focuses, I know I know some might me call me an overachiever but I'm not the only one.

The one focus of mine is learning and potentially replicating the A.I. systems and techniques utilised in popular games. However, this is not really considered "research" ... apparently.

So my other focus is the development of agents which can learn to perform optimally in various video game domains.
