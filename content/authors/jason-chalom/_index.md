I'm a software engineer at a startup called DocFox. Im also a part time masters candidate at the University of the Witwatersrand. I have an interest in AI and its applications. I also like video games and making things out of carbon foam (wood).

My research is currently focused on computer vision in autonomous vehicles and understanding what such a system is learning and what features are relevant to its decisions - attribution of AI systems
