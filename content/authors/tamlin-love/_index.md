I am a PhD student at the Institut de Robotica i Informàtica Industrial (IRI) (under CSIC and UPC) in Barcelona, working on the TRAIL Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral Network under the supervision of Guillem Alenyà.

I obtained my MSc at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, under the supervision of Benjamin Rosman and Ritesh Ajoodha. From 2022 - 2023 I worked as a sessional lecturer at the same institution. I am also a research associate of the Robotics, Autonomous Intelligence and Learning Lab (RAIL).

I am very interested in the intersection of humans and intelligent systems, particularly robots and reinforcement learning agents. I believe interaction between humans and machines can be beneficial for both parties, with humans assisting agents in learning (e.g. assisted RL) and robots assisting humans in particular tasks (e.g. social robotics). More generally, I am also interested in ethical, explainable and safe implementations of these systems.

My more recent avenues of interest include causality, and the role it has to play in making robot systems explainable in HRI settings.
