Hey there! I'm a passionate individual with two primary interests: basketball and computer science. As a basketball enthusiast, I've always been captivated by the sport's mechanics. On the other hand, computer science fascinated me from a not-so-early age.

In a past life, I worked as a software developer. However, the emergence of neural networks and artificial intelligence changed my trajectory. Now, I'm fully dedicated to exploring the potential of AI and its impact on various industries.
