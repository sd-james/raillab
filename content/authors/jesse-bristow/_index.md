I matriculated from Maragon Ruimsig in 2017 and completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Witswaterstrand. Sports have always been a big passion of mine, especially cricket. I thoroughly enjoy spending time with friends and taking part in activities outdoors. I love to build awesome things using machine learning and robotics, more specifically, I find Reinforcement Learning very interesting and enjoyable.
