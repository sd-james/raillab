To create truly intelligent machines, we need to understand how the human brain works and how to replicate its functions in artificial systems. I am thus interested in exploring AI from a neuroscience perspective, combining insights from Anthropology, Neuroanatomy, and Psychology, to develop and further understand artificial systems.

AI has also made significant contributions to helping us understand human cognition. I am interested in developing AI systems that mimic human thought processes for greater insights into how the human brain works.
