Hey! I'm Altaaf Ally—a master's student in Computer Science and a part-time Data Scientist Intern currently living my best double life: wrangling data by day and dominating online matches by night.

My research focuses on player modeling and dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) in video games, with the goal of making AI opponents feel less like clueless side characters and more like worthy rivals. I want to build game systems that adapt to your style—whether you're a stealthy strategist or a full-send berserker.

Professionally, I've worked on predictive modeling, data engineering, and analytics at the University of the Witwatersrand's Business Intelligence Services, mostly using Python, SQL, and AWS to turn raw data into actionable insight.

When I'm not knee-deep in code or dataframes, I'm grinding in Marvel Rivals ranked, catching up on anime (you know One Piece is always top-tier), or organizing my One Piece TCG cards like a treasure hoard. I also love single-player story games, collecting comics, and hitting the gym like it's a boss fight. You'll find me on a padel court, soccer field, or tennis court whenever I'm AFK.

At heart, I'm a proud geek who's passionate about making smart systems, building cool stuff, and occasionally yelling “I'm gonna be King of the Coders!” when my script finally runs without errors.
