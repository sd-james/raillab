I am a lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, where I've spent my entire academic career.

My interest in AI stems from writing my own chess engine - it should therefore come as no surprise that I am very interested in games, be they board, video or logic.

My main research interests revolve around developing agent capable of autonomously learning their own abstract representations that can be reused in new domains.
