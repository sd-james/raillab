I work in Learning from Demonstration, with a focus on Skill Discovery. The central idea is that we are losing a lot of information if we view expert demonstrations as atomic. Behaviour recorded from an expert can be decomposed into component skills which can then be reused in contexts that the demonstrator does not have to anticipate.

I am also interested in technological aids in education and healthcare, with a particular focus on how to help deliver a reasonable service in an extremely under-resourced environment such as South Africa. This occasionally ties into my primary field of machine learning, but other times not.
