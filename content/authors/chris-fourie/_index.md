Medical doctor turned health data scientist, trying to use the powers of AI for social good. Currently busy with a Computer Science masters and interested in research at the intersections of theoretical / computational neuroscience and machine learning.

I enjoy long-ish walks in the mountains and will board down any snowy stretch of hillside that happens to be nearby

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and theoretical / computational neuroscience. I am interested in investigating biological computation & biologically plausible neural network.

Additionally I research and application of machine learning with regards to healthcare is a topic I am passionate about. The potential impact-factor in areas such as primary health care that, for instance computer aided diagnosis can produce, is incredibly scalable.
