I have experience with theoretical approaches to machine learning and neuroscience. I am particularly interested in understanding the emergence of meso-scale structure in the brain and how these structures function computationally and algorithmically to learn high-level (semantic) concepts from low level sensory inputs. Additionally, I aim to understand how these high-level concepts are leveraged for systematic generalization and context appropriate controlled cognition.
