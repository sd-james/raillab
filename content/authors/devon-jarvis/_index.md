My main focus is on objective reasoning in machine learning algorithms. So far this has involved work on the theory behind the generalizability and loss landscapes of neural networks using tools from objective Bayesian statistics and information geometry.

I have also worked on behaviour learning for autonomous agents using knowledge distillation. Through this work I have also dealt with Computer Vision algorithms (CNNs and their saliency maps).

Lastly I work with the various robots in the lab, in particular with the always friendly (and often frustrating) Kuri robot.
