abstract: "Semantic segmentation using fully convolutional networks
  has quickly become a popular solution as they provide very
  accurate per pixel classification. However, the implementation
  of deconvolutional layers and their mechanics differ greatly to
  those of patch based segmentation using convolutional neural
  networks. Both techniques have been used for road segmentation
  from satellite imagery but never compared. Thus we investigate
  the difference between fully connected and deconvolutional layers
  and provide an interpretation as to the correlation and differences
  between each methodology for road segmentation from satellite
  imagery."
