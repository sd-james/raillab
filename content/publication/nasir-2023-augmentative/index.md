abstract: "We tackle the problem of open-ended learning by introducing a method that simultaneously evolves agents while
  also evolving increasingly challenging environments. Unlike previous open-ended approaches that optimize agents using a 
  fixed neural network topology, we hypothesize that generalization can be improved by allowing agents' controllers to
  become more complex as they encounter more difficult environments. Our method, Augmentative Topology EPOET (ATEP),
  extends the Enhanced Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (EPOET) algorithm by allowing agents to evolve their own neural 
  network structures over time, adding complexity and capacity as necessary. Our empirical results demonstrate that ATEP 
  produces general agents capable of solving more environments than fixed-topology baselines. We also investigate mechanisms 
  for transferring agents between environments and find that a species-based approach further improves the performance and 
  generalization of agents."
