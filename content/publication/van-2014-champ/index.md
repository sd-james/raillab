abstract: "Mobile manipulation is a robotics paradigm with
  the potential to make major contributions to a number of
  important domain areas. Although some mobile manipulators
  are commercially available, bespoke systems can be assembled
  from existing and separate mobile, manipulation, and vision
  components. This has the benefit of reusing existing hardware, at
  a lower cost, to produce a customised platform. In this paper we
  introduce CHAMP, the CSIR Hybrid Autonomous Manipulation
  Platform, and describe the required integration of a Barrett
  Whole Arm Manipulator, a PowerBot AGV, and the necessary
  sensors. The described integration includes both the hardware
  and the software."
