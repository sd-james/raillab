abstract: Researchers have made a lot of progress in combining the advances in Deep Learning and the generalization and
  applicability of Reinforcement learning to the sequential decision-making process and introduce Deep Reinforcement
  Learning, which allows using Reinforcement Learning in high dimensional input space environments. Deep Reinforcement
  Learning achieved notable results in Atari-Games, continuous control tasks such as Robotics. In this project we benchmark
  the performance of three different deep reinforcement Learning techniques Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient "DDPG" [1],
  Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient with Hindsight Experience Replay "DDPG + HER" [2] and state-of-art policy gradient method
  Proximal Policy optimization "PPO" [3], on multi-goal continuous control environments Fetch task and HandManipulate tasks, we
  benchmarked the three algorithms on six different environments using sparse and dense reward settings. Deep Deterministic
  Policy Gradient with Hindsight Experience Replay [2] achieves the best success-rate overall the environments when applied
  with sparse rewards, while both Proximal Policy Optimization [3] and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient [1] were able to
  converge only on FetchReach environment.
