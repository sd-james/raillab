abstract: Video game developers are increasingly utilising procedural
  content generation (PCG) techniques in order to generate
  more content far quicker than if it were designed. Although
  promising, much of the successful work to date has
  been achieved in simple 2D environments or has required significant
  hand-designed effort. This is due to the difficult nature
  of defining plausible metrics, fitness functions or reward
  functions which can quantify the quality of generated levels.
  Our work aims to avoid this difficulty by utilising minimal
  human design to build up constraints, and generating diverse
  levels that maintain these constraints.We achieve this by hierarchically
  applying the recentWaveFunction collapse (WFC)
  algorithm. Our approach allows designers to specify larger-scale
  components, and additional constraints that are difficult
  to enforce using standard WFC. We empirically demonstrate
  that our approach does indeed incorporate these higher-level
  structures, and is more controllable than our baselines. Despite
  these benefits, our levels do not suffer from a lack of
  diversity. Finally, we illustrate the scalability and flexibility
  of our approach by applying it to both 2D and 3D domains.
