abstract: "Robot vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals
  with how robots can be made to gain high-level understanding
  from digital images or videos. Understanding an image at
  the pixel level often does not provide enough information for
  decision making and action taking. In this case, higher level
  semantic information that describes the image is required. This
  helps the robot to accomplish complex tasks that require visual
  understanding. For robots to add value they need to be sufficiently effective
  at executing tasks in different settings. Despite many impressive
  advances in robot vision, robots still lack the ability to function
  as humans do in complex environments. Importantly, this
  includes being able to interpret and understand the perceptual
  complexities of the world. Robot vision is dependant on ideas from both computer vision
  and machine learning. In this paper we provide a overview of the
  advances in these disciplines and how they contribute to robot
  vision."
