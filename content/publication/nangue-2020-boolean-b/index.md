abstract: "We propose a framework for defining a Boolean algebra over the space of tasks.
  This allows us to formulate new tasks in terms of the negation, disjunction and
  conjunction of a set of base tasks. We then show that by learning goal-oriented
  value functions and restricting the transition dynamics of the tasks, an agent can
  solve these new tasks with no further learning. We prove that by composing these
  value functions in specific ways, we immediately recover the optimal policies for
  all tasks expressible under the Boolean algebra."
