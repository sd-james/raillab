abstract: "The ability to produce novel behaviours from existing
  skills is an important property of lifelong-learning
  agents. We build on recent work which
  formalises a Boolean algebra over the space of
  tasks and value functions, and show how this can
  be leveraged to tackle the lifelong learning problem.
  We propose an algorithm that determines
  whether a new task can be immediately solved
  using an agentâ€™s existing abilities, or whether the
  task should be learned from scratch. We verify
  our approach in the Four Rooms domain, where
  an agent learns a set of skills throughout its lifetime,
  and then composes them to solve a combinatorially
  large number of new tasks in a zero-shot
  manner."
