abstract: "We present a framework for autonomously learning a portable representation that describes a collection
  of low-level continuous environments. We show that these abstract representations can be learned in a task-independent egocentric space
  specific to the agent that, when grounded with problem-specific information, are provably sufficient
  for planning. We demonstrate transfer in two different domains, where an agent learns a
  portable, task-independent symbolic vocabulary, as well as operators expressed in that vocabulary,
  and then learns to instantiate those operators on a per-task basis. This reduces the number of samples
  required to learn a representation of a new task."
