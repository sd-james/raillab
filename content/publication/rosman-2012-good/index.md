abstract: "The computational complexity of learning in sequential
  decision problems grows exponentially with the number of
  actions available to the agent at each state. We present a method
  for accelerating this process by learning action priors that express
  the usefulness of each action in each state. These are learned from
  a set of different optimal policies from many tasks in the same
  state space, and are used to bias exploration away from less useful
  actions. This is shown to improve performance for tasks in the
  same domain but with different goals. We extend our method
  to base action priors on perceptual cues rather than absolute
  states, allowing the transfer of these priors between tasks with
  differing state spaces and transition functions, and demonstrate
  experimentally the advantages of learning with action priors in
  a reinforcement learning context."
