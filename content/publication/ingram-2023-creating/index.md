abstract: Developing diverse and realistic agents in terms of behaviour and skill is crucial for game developers to 
  enhance player satisfaction and immersion. Traditional game design approaches involve hand-crafted solutions, while 
  learning game-playing agents often focuses on optimizing for a single objective, or play-style. These processes typically
  lack intuitiveness, fail to resemble realistic behaviour, and do not encompass a diverse spectrum of play-styles at 
  varying levels of skill. To this end, our goal is to learn a set of policies that exhibit diverse behaviours or styles 
  while also demonstrating diversity in skill level. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline, called PCPG 
  (Play-style-Centric Policy Generation), which combines unsupervised play-style identification and policy
  learning techniques to generate a diverse set of play-style-centric agents. The agents generated by the pipeline can
  effectively capture the richness and diversity of gameplay experiences in multiple video game domains, showcasing 
  identifiable and diverse play-styles at varying levels of proficiency.
