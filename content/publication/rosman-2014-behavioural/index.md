abstract: "An agent continuously performing different tasks in
  the same domain has the opportunity to learn, over the
  course of its operational lifetime, about the behavioural
  regularities afforded by the domain. This paper addresses
  the problem of learning a task independent behaviour
  model based on the underlying structure of a
  domain which is common across multiple tasks presented
  to an autonomous agent. Our approach involves
  learning action priors: a behavioural model which encodes
  a notion of local common sense behaviours in the
  domain, conditioned on either the state or observations
  of the agent. This knowledge is accumulated and transferred
  as an exploration behaviour whenever a new task
  is presented to the agent. The effect is that as the agent
  encounters more tasks, it is able to learn them faster and
  achieve greater overall performance. This approach is
  illustrated in experiments in a simulated extended navigation
  domain."
