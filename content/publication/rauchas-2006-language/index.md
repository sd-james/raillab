abstract: "We describe the first part of a study investigating the usefulness
  of high school language results as a predictor of success
  in first year computer science courses at a university where
  students have widely varying English language skills. Our
  results indicate that contrary to the generally accepted view
  that achievement in high school mathematics courses is the
  best individual predictor of success in undergraduate computer
  science, success in English at the first-language level
  in high school correlates better with actual performance.
  We discuss the implications of this for universities whose
  medium of teaching is English, operating in social contexts
  where many students are not native English speakers."
