abstract: "We develop an end-to-end model for learning to follow language instructions with
  compositional policies. Our model combines large language models with pretrained
  compositional value functions [Nangue Tasse et al., 2020] to generate policies
  for goal-reaching tasks specified in natural language. We evaluate our method
  in the BabyAI [Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2019] environment and demonstrate
  compositional generalization to novel combinations of task attributes. Notably our
  method generalizes to held-out combinations of attributes, and in some cases can
  accomplish those tasks with no additional learning samples."
