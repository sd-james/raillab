abstract: "Interactive interfaces are a common feature of many systems
  ranging from field robotics to video games. In most applications,
  these interfaces must be used by a heterogeneous set
  of users, with substantial variety in effectiveness with the
  same interface when configured differently. We address the
  issue of personalizing such an interface, adapting parameters
  to present the user with an environment that is optimal
  with respect to their individual traits - enabling that particular
  user to achieve their personal optimum. We introduce a
  new class of problem in interface personalization where the
  task of the adaptive interface is to choose the subset of actions
  of the full interface to present to the user. In formalizing
  this problem, we model the user as a Markov decision process
  (MDP), wherein the transition dynamics within a task
  depends on the type (e.g., skill or dexterity) of the user, where
  the type parametrizes the MDP. The action set of the MDP is
  divided into disjoint set of actions, with different action-sets
  optimal for different type (transition dynamics). The task of
  the adaptive interface is then to choose the right action-set.
  Given this formalization, we present experiments with simulated
  and human users in a video game domain to show
  that (a) action set selection is an interesting class of problems
  (b) adaptively choosing the right action set improves performance
  over sticking to a fixed action set and (c) immediately
  applicable approaches such as bandits can be improved upon."
