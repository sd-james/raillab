abstract: We consider how to construct state abstractions compatible with a given set of abstract actions, to obtain a 
  well-formed abstract Markov decision process (MDP). We show that the Bellman equation suggests that abstract states 
  should represent distributions over states in the ground MDP; we characterize the conditions under which the resulting
  process is Markov and approximately model-preserving, derive algorithms for constructing and planning with the abstract MDP,
  and apply them to a visual maze task. We generalize these results to the factored actions case, characterizing the 
  conditions that result in factored abstract states and apply the resulting algorithm to Montezuma's Revenge. These
  results provide a powerful and principled framework for constructing neurosymbolic abstract Markov decision processes.
