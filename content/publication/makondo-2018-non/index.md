abstract: "The number and variety of robots active in real-world
  environments are growing, as well as the skills they
  are expected to acquire, and to this end we present
  an approach for non-robotics-expert users to be able
  to easily teach a skill to a robot with potentially different,
  but unknown, kinematics from humans. This
  paper proposes a method that enables robots with unknown
  kinematics to learn skills from demonstrations.
  Our proposed method requires a motion trajectory obtained
  from human demonstrations via a vision-based
  system, which is then projected onto a corresponding
  human skeletal model. The kinematics mapping
  between the robot and the human model is learned
  by employing Local Procrustes Analysis, a manifold
  alignment technique which enables the transfer of the
  demonstrated trajectory from the human model to
  the robot. Finally, the transferred trajectory is encoded
  onto a parameterized motion skill, using DynamicMovement
  Primitives, allowing it to be generalized
  to different situations. Experiments in simulation
  on the PR2 and Meka robots show that our method
  is able to correctly imitate various skills demonstrated
  by a human, and an analysis of the transfer of the acquired
  skills between the two robots is provided."
