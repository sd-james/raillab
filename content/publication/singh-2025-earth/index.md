abstract: "Invasive species management is often constrained by limited resources and complicated by ecological and 
  socio-economic variability across landscapes, leading to inconsistent outcomes. We use water hyacinth 
  (Pontederia crassipes) in South Africa as a case study to demonstrate how combining earth observation (EO) data,
  species distribution models (SDMs), and explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) can support more spatially explicit
  and context-sensitive management strategies. Despite decades of control efforts, water hyacinth remains widespread, 
  with its proliferation shaped by ecological and socio-economic contexts in which the weed proliferates. Using SHapley 
  Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we studied the environmental and socio-economic contexts impacting water hyacinth prevalence 
  across multiple spatial scales in South Africa. Consistent patterns emerged with known physiological constraints, such as
  minimum temperature, while novel spatial trends were revealed—highlighting temperature effects along the coast and 
  the role of vegetation type in inland regions. These insights offer opportunities for targeted fieldwork to 
  investigate emergent non-linear relationships and interaction effects between covariates. The spatially explicit 
  outputs, covering all South African water bodies, provide a low-cost, scalable tool to guide the prioritization of 
  risk, inform monitoring and early detection efforts, and support the selection of locally appropriate management 
  strategies. While focused on water hyacinth, our approach is generalizable to other invasive species, illustrating 
  the value of integrating EO data and xAI to enhance understanding of species-environment dynamics and enable adaptive,
  data-driven intervention planning."
