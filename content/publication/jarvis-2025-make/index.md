abstract: "In spite of finite dimension ReLU neural networks being a consistent factor behind recent deep learning successes,
 a theory of feature learning in these models remains elusive. Currently, insightful theories still rely on assumptions 
 including the linearity of the network computations, unstructured input data and architectural constraints such as infinite 
 width or a single hidden layer. To begin to address this gap we establish an equivalence between ReLU networks and Gated 
 Deep Linear Networks, and use their greater tractability to derive dynamics of learning. We then consider multiple variants 
 of a core task reminiscent of multi-task learning or contextual control which requires both feature learning and nonlinearity.
 We make explicit that, for these tasks, the ReLU networks possess an inductive bias towards latent representations which 
 are not strictly modular or disentangled but are still highly structured and reusable between contexts. This effect is 
 amplified with the addition of more contexts and hidden layers. Thus, we take a step towards a theory of feature learning in
 finite ReLU networks and shed light on how structured mixed-selective latent representations can emerge due to a bias for
 node-reuse and learning speed."
