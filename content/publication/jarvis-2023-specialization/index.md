abstract: "A number of machine learning models have been proposed with the goal of achieving
  systematic generalization: the ability to reason about new situations by combining
  aspects of previous experiences. These models leverage compositional
  architectures which aim to learn specialized modules dedicated to structures in a
  task that can be composed to solve novel problems with similar structures. While
  the compositionality of these architectures is guaranteed by design, the modules
  specializing is not. Here we theoretically study the ability of network modules
  to specialize to useful structures in a dataset and achieve systematic generalization.
  To this end we introduce a minimal space of datasets motivated by practical
  systematic generalization benchmarks. From this space of datasets we present a
  mathematical definition of systematicity and study the learning dynamics of linear
  neural modules when solving components of the task. Our results shed light on the
  difficulty of module specialization, what is required for modules to successfully
  specialize, and the necessity of modular architectures to achieve systematicity.
  Finally, we confirm that the theoretical results in our tractable setting generalize to
  more complex datasets and non-linear architectures."
