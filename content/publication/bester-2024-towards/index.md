abstract: "Financial inclusion ensures that individuals have access to financial products and services that meet their needs. 
  As a key contributing factor to economic growth and investment opportunity, financial inclusion increases consumer spending
  and consequently business development. It has been shown that institutions are more profitable when they provide marginalised 
  social groups access to financial services. Customer segmentation based on consumer transaction data is a well-known strategy
  used to promote financial inclusion. While the required data is available to modern institutions, the challenge
  remains that segment annotations are usually difficult and/or expensive to obtain. This prevents the usage of time
  series classification models for customer segmentation based on domain expert knowledge. As a result, clustering is 
  an attractive alternative to partition customers into homogeneous groups based on the spending behaviour encoded within
  their transaction data. In this paper, we present a solution to one of the key challenges preventing modern financial
  institutions from providing financially inclusive credit, savings and insurance products: the inability to understand
  consumer financial behaviour, and hence risk, without the introduction of restrictive conventional credit scoring 
  techniques. We present a novel time series clustering algorithm that allows institutions to understand the financial
  behaviour of their customers. This enables unique product offerings to be provided based on the needs of the customer, 
  without reliance on restrictive credit practices."
