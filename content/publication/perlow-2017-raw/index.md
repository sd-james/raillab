abstract: "An important step in the construction of novel
  objects is the ability to recognise combinations of raw materials
  which are likely to be useful. We aim to exploit the intuition
  that the visual characteristics of candidate raw materials provide
  useful cues to their potential combinations. Toward this end, we
  present a Siamese neural network based model that is able to
  recognise unseen raw materials present in objects given a list
  of candidate material images. We demonstrate the utility and
  efficacy of our model within two domains. The first being a proof-of-concept
  within Minecraft where we predict the combinations
  of objects that will result in a target object. The second, more
  realistic domain, uses the ShapeNet 3D model dataset where
  we attempt to recover the materials present in a model. We
  empirically demonstrate that our model is able to learn from a
  subset of object material pairs and generalise to unseen objects,
  materials, texture packs. Under these conditions of high visual
  variation, we show that our model outperforms chance and
  baseline methods."
