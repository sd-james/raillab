abstract: Establishing intelligent crop management techniques for preserving the soil, while providing 
  next-generational food supply for an increasing population is critical. Nitrogen fertilizer is used in current
  farming practice as a way of encouraging crop development; however, its excessive use is found to have
  disastrous and long-lasting effects on the environment. This can be reduced through the optimization of 
  fertilizer application strategies. In this work, we apply a set of reinforcement learning algorithms – the DQN,
  Double DQN, Dueling DDQN, and PPO – to learn novel strategies for reducing this application in a simulated 
  crop growth setting. We provide an analysis of each agent’s ability and show that the Dueling DDQN agent can 
  learn favourable strategies for minimizing nitrogen fertilizer application amounts, while maintaining a 
  sufficient yield comparable to standard farming practice.
