abstract: In any game, play style is a concept that describes the technique and strategy employed by a player to achieve
  a goal. Identifying a player's style is desirable as it can enlighten players on which approaches work better or worse
  in different scenarios and inform developers of the value of design decisions. In previous work, we demonstrated an
  unsupervised LSTM-autoencoder clustering approach for play-style identification capable of handling multi-dimensional
  variable length player trajectories. The efficacy of our model was demonstrated on both complete and partial trajectories
  in both a simulated and natural environment. Lastly, through state frequency analysis the properties of each of the play
  styles were identified and compared. This work expands on this approach by demonstrating a process by which we utilise
  temporal information to identify the decision boundaries related to particular clusters. Additionally, we demonstrate
  further robustness by applying the same techniques to MiniDungeons, another popular domain for player modelling research.
  Finally, we also propose approaches for determining mean play-style examples suitable for describing general play-style
  behaviours and for determining the correct number of represented play-styles.
