abstract: "Different interfaces allow a user to achieve the same end goal
  through different action sequences, e.g., command lines vs.
  drop down menus. Interface efficiency can be described in
  terms of a cost incurred, e.g., time taken, by the user in typical
  tasks. Realistic users arrive at evaluations of efficiency,
  hence making choices about which interface to use, over time,
  based on trial and error experience. Their choices are also determined
  by prior experience, which determines how much
  learning time is required. These factors have substantial effect
  on the adoption of new interfaces. In this paper, we aim at
  understanding how users adapt under interface change, how
  much time it takes them to learn to interact optimally with an
  interface, and how this learning could be expedited through
  intermediate interfaces. We present results from a series of
  experiments that make four main points: (a) different interfaces
  for accomplishing the same task can elicit significant
  variability in performance, (b) switching interfaces can result
  in adverse sharp shifts in performance, (c) subject to some
  variability, there are individual thresholds on tolerance to this
  kind of performance degradation with an interface, causing
  users to potentially abandon what may be a pretty good interface,
  and (d) our main result â€“ shaping user learning through
  the presentation of intermediate interfaces can mitigate the
  adverse shifts in performance while still enabling the eventual
  improved performance with the complex interface upon
  the user becoming suitably accustomed. In our experiments,
  human users use keyboard based interfaces to navigate a simulated
  ball through a maze. Our results are a first step towards
  interface adaptation algorithms that architect choice to
  accommodate personality traits of realistic users."
