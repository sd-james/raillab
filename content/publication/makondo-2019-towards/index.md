abstract: "This paper investigates the improvement of learning
  sensorimotor models for developmental robots, in particular
  robot arm kinematics models, with inter-robot knowledge transfer.
  Developmental robots progressively learn through embodied
  interaction with the physical environment. In the single-robot
  case, exploration in the world is performed in isolation and
  the robot explores its own capabilities. In a multi-robot case,
  with one or more experienced robots, we argue that it may be
  beneficial for the robots to be able to share the knowledge they
  have acquired through their individual exploration. We explore
  knowledge transfer in the context of learning arm kinematics
  models, where an experienced robot shares its kinematic data
  with a new robot that is autonomously exploring its environment.
  We show that the sensorimotor models of the new robot can be
  bootstrapped by the shared knowledge, converge faster and also
  achieve a better asymptotic performance compared to individual
  exploration from scratch. We perform an analysis of knowledge
  transfer in simulation, ranging from simple two-link planar
  robots to redundant systems."
