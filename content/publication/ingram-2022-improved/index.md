abstract: Action prediction in video games is the process of extracting useful information in order to predict 
  the future actions of a player. Long-range dependencies and the dynamic nature of video games make it 
  difficult for most algorithms to accurately predict the future actions of players. We propose a novel machine
  learning approach to improving future action prediction from video game trajectories. This method requires 
  having first clustered player trajectories based on behaviour similarities. Our model consists of a set of 
  LSTM based prediction modules each trained on a subset of data based upon a respective cluster. The
  effectiveness of our model is analysed on both a synthetic and natural dataset. We find that our future 
  action prediction approach of leveraging multiple models trained on individual data subsets results in 
  greater accuracy over a single model on a complete dataset.
