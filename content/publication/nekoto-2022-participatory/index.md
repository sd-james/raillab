abstract: In this paper, we describe a participatory, collaborative, and cost-effective process for creating
  translations in Oshiwambo, the most widely spoken African language in Namibia. We aim to (1) build a
  resource for language technology development, (2) bridge generational gaps in cultural and language knowledge,
  and at the same time (3) provide socio-economic opportunities through language preservation. The created
  data spans diverse topics of cultural importance, and comprises over 7.5k sentences written in the 
  Oshindonga dialect and translated to English, the largest parallel corpus for Oshiwambo to-date. We show 
  that it is very effective for machine translation, especially when combined with transfer learning.
