abstract: "We propose a method for autonomously learning
  an object-centric representation of a highdimensional
  environment that is suitable for planning.
  Such abstractions can be immediately transferred
  between tasks that share the same types of
  objects, resulting in agents that require fewer samples
  to learn a model of a new task. We demonstrate
  our approach on a series of Minecraft tasks
  to learn object-centric representations---directly
  from pixel data---that can be leveraged to quickly
  solve new tasks. The resulting learned representations
  enable the use of a task-level planner, resulting
  in an agent capable of forming complex,
  long-term plans"
