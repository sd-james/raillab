abstract: "The high variability of fingerprint data (owing to, e.g.,
  differences in quality, moisture conditions, and scanners)
  makes the task of minutiae extraction challenging, particularly
  when approached from a stance that relies on tunable
  algorithmic components, such as image enhancement.
  We pose minutiae extraction as a machine learning problem
  and propose a deep neural network – MENet, for Minutiae
  Extraction Network – to learn a data-driven representation
  of minutiae points. By using the existing capabilities of
  several minutiae extraction algorithms, we establish a voting
  scheme to construct training data, and so train MENet
  in an automated fashion on a large dataset for robustness
  and portability, thus eliminating the need for tedious manual
  data labelling. We present a post-processing procedure
  that determines precise minutiae locations from the output
  of MENet. We show that MENet performs favourably in
  comparisons against existing minutiae extractors."
