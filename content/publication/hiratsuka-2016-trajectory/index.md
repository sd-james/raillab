abstract: "This work proposes a framework that enables
  arbitrary robots with unknown kinematics models to imitate
  human demonstrations to acquire a skill, and reproduce it
  in real-time. The diversity of robots active in non-laboratory
  environments is growing constantly, and to this end we present
  an approach for users to be able to easily teach a skill to a robot
  with any body configuration. Our proposed method requires
  a motion trajectory obtained from human demonstrations via
  a Kinect sensor, which is then projected onto a corresponding
  human skeleton model. The kinematics mapping between
  the robot and the human model is learned by employing
  Local Procrustes Analysis, which enables the transfer of the
  demonstrated trajectory from the human model to the robot.
  Finally, the transferred trajectory is modeled using Dynamic
  Movement Primitives, allowing it to be reproduced in real time.
  Experiments in simulation on a 4 degree of freedom robot
  show that our method is able to correctly imitate various skills
  demonstrated by a human."
