abstract: "Procedural Content Generation Via Machine Learning (PCGML), describes an evolving area of research, that
  incorporates the use of machine learning models in a generative context. These innovative approaches accelerate the 
  creation of content while concurrently reducing the need for human intervention. In particular, autoencoder models 
  have been steadily employed in collaboration with supporting algorithms to facilitate the generation of novel game 
  content. The standard autoencoder provides a means of replicating given data by learning a lower dimensional embedding,
  called the latent representation. Applying various operations to these representations can yield uniquely diverse content.
  This paper offers a versatile and robust framework for game level generation using a standard autoencoder for level
  generation and a denoising autoencoder for level repair and enhancement. Additionally, the integration of clustering
  techniques effectively identifies the core components that make up the various types of levels in a Rogue-like game
  domain. The essence of this approach lies in harnessing the knowledge within the clusters to guide the mutation
  phase of the levelâ€™s latent spaces. This refined methodology provides significant insights on level analysis,
  generation and repair, highlighting how autoencoders can be used as a basis for game development."
