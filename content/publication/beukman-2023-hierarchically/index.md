abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) is a growing field, with numerous applications in the video game industry 
  and great potential to help create better games at a fraction of the cost of manual creation. However, much of the work 
  in PCG is focused on generating relatively straightforward levels in simple games, as it is challenging to design an
  optimisable objective function for complex settings. This limits the applicability of PCG to more complex and modern 
  titles, hindering its adoption in industry. Our work aims to address this limitation by introducing a compositional
  level generation method that recursively composes simple low-level generators to construct large and complex creations.
  This approach allows for easily-optimisable objectives and the ability to design a complex structure in an interpretable
  way by referencing lower-level components. We empirically demonstrate that our method outperforms a non-compositional
  baseline by more accurately satisfying a designer's functional requirements in several tasks. Finally, we provide a 
  qualitative showcase (in Minecraft) illustrating the large and complex, but still coherent, structures that were generated
  using simple base generators.
