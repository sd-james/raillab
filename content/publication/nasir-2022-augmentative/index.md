abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of open-ended
  learning by introducing a method that simultaneously
  evolves agents and increasingly challenging environments.
  Unlike previous open-ended approaches that
  optimize agents using a fixed neural network topology, we
  hypothesize that generalization can be improved by allowing
  agents' controllers to become more complex as they
  encounter more difficult environments. Our method, Augmentative
  Topology EPOET (ATEP), extends the Enhanced
  Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (EPOET) algorithm by
  allowing agents to evolve their own neural network structures
  over time, adding complexity and capacity as necessary.
  Empirical results demonstrate that ATEP results in
  general agents capable of solving more environments than a
  fixed-topology baseline. We also investigate mechanisms for
  transferring agents between environments and find that a
  species-based approach further improves the performance
  and generalization of agents.
