abstract: "As a key component of collaborative robots (cobots) working with
  humans, existing decision-making approaches try to model the uncertainty
  in human behaviors as latent variables. However, as more
  possible contingencies are covered by such intention-aware models,
  they face slow convergence times and less accurate responses.
  For this purpose, we present a novel anticipatory policy selection
  mechanism built on existing intention-aware models, where a robot
  is required to choose from an existing set of policies based on an
  estimate of the human. Each of these intention-aware robot models
  anticipates and adapts to a different human’s short-term changing
  behaviors. Our contribution is the Anticipatory Bayesian Policy
  Selection (ABPS) mechanism which selects from a library of different
  response policies that are generated from such models, and
  converges to a reliable policy after as few interactions as possible
  when faced with unknown humans. The selection is based on the
  estimation of the human in terms of long-term workplace characteristics
  that we call types, such as level of expertise, stamina,
  attention and collaborativeness. Our results show that incorporating
  this policy selection mechanism contributes positively to the
  efficiency and naturalness of the collaboration, when compared to
  the best intention-aware model in hindsight running alone."
