abstract: "South Africa has one of the highest rates of sexual violence in the world, and with this technology era being the 
  information age, it is not suprising that people are turning to social media to voice their views on this matter. As
  tweets on sexual violence grow continually, extracting insights from such data demands a robust, real-time, and scalable
  tools with flexibility in the database schema. Elasticsearch (ES) is an example of a free-license search engine written in
  Java and developed on Apache Lucene that meets the stated requirements. On the other hand, Kibana facilitates intuitive
  dashboard development, visual exploration, and real-time analysis of an index in ES through an intuitive graphical user 
  interface. This study demonstrates how gender was inferred and evaluated through the integration of deep neural networks 
  and Google's TensorFlow. We used the AFINN model to infer sentiment analysis as our measure of gender disparity in this 
  instance. The Indexer, built of Node. js, and defined as the hub of the system connects with the Twitter streaming API to
  ingest tweets found within the boundaries of sexual violence. This system runs persistently with tweets through the ES
  search engine and visualised in Kibana."
