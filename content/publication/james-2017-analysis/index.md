abstract: "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a family of directed
  search algorithms that has gained widespread attention in recent
  years. Despite the vast amount of research into MCTS,
  the effect of modifications on the algorithm, as well as the
  manner in which it performs in various domains, is still not
  yet fully known. In particular, the effect of using knowledgeheavy
  rollouts in MCTS still remains poorly understood, with
  surprising results demonstrating that better-informed rollouts
  often result in worse-performing agents. We present experimental
  evidence suggesting that, under certain smoothness
  conditions, uniformly random simulation policies preserve
  the ordering over action preferences. This explains the success
  of MCTS despite its common use of these rollouts to
  evaluate states. We further analyse non-uniformly random
  rollout policies and describe conditions under which they offer
  improved performance."
