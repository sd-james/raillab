abstract: Procedurally generated video game content has the potential to drastically reduce the content
  creation budget of game developers and large studios. However, adoption is hindered by limitations
  such as slow generation, as well as low quality and diversity of
  content. We introduce an evolutionary search-based approach for
  evolving level generators using novelty search to procedurally generate
  diverse levels in real time, without requiring training data or
  detailed domain-specific knowledge. We test our method on two
  domains, and our results show an order of magnitude speedup in
  generation time compared to existing methods while obtaining
  comparable metric scores. We further demonstrate the ability to
  generalise to arbitrary-sized levels without retraining.
