abstract: We present a framework for the automatic encoding and repair of high-level tasks. Given a set of skills a robot 
  can perform, our approach first abstracts sensor data into symbols and then automatically encodes the robot's 
  capabilities in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Using this encoding, a user can specify reactive high-level tasks, 
  for which we can automatically synthesize a strategy that executes on the robot, if the task is feasible. If a 
  task is not feasible given the robot's capabilities, we present two methods, one enumeration-based and one synthesis-based,
  for automatically suggesting additional skills for the robot or modifications to existing skills that would make
  the task feasible. We demonstrate our framework on a Baxter robot manipulating blocks on a table, a Baxter robot 
  manipulating plates on a table, and a Kinova arm manipulating vials, with multiple sensor modalities, including raw images.
