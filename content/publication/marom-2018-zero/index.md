abstract: "Object-oriented representations in reinforcement learning have shown promise
  in transfer learning, with previous research introducing a propositional object-oriented
  framework that has provably efficient learning bounds with respect to
  sample complexity. However, this framework has limitations in terms of the classes
  of tasks it can efficiently learn. In this paper we introduce a novel deictic object-oriented
  framework that has provably efficient learning bounds and can solve a
  broader range of tasks. Additionally, we show that this framework is capable
  of zero-shot transfer of transition dynamics across tasks and demonstrate this
  empirically for the Taxi and Sokoban domains."
