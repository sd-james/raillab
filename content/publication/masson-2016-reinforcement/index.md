abstract: "We introduce a model-free algorithm for learning in Markov
  decision processes with parameterized actionsâ€”discrete actions
  with continuous parameters. At each step the agent must
  select both which action to use and which parameters to use
  with that action. We introduce the Q-PAMDP algorithm for
  learning in these domains, show that it converges to a local
  optimum, and compare it to direct policy search in the goalscoring
  and Platform domains."
