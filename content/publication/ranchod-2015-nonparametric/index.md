abstract: "We present a method for segmenting a set of
  unstructured demonstration trajectories to discover reusable
  skills using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each skill is
  characterised by a latent reward function which the demonstrator
  is assumed to be optimizing. The skill boundaries and the
  number of skills making up each demonstration are unknown.
  We use a Bayesian nonparametric approach to propose skill
  segmentations and maximum entropy inverse reinforcement
  learning to infer reward functions from the segments. This
  method produces a set of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
  that best describe the input trajectories. We evaluate this
  approach in a car driving domain and a simulated quadcopter
  obstacle course, showing that it is able to recover demonstrated
  skills more effectively than existing methods."
