abstract: "We propose an architecture as a robot's decision-making mechanism
  to anticipate a human's state of mind, and so plan accordingly
  during a human-robot collaboration task. At the core of the architecture
  lies a novel stochastic decision-making mechanism that
  implements a partially observable Markov decision process anticipating
  a human's state of mind in two-stages. In the first stage it
  anticipates the human's task related availability, intent (motivation),
  and capability during the collaboration. In the second, it further
  reasons about these states to anticipate the human's true need for
  help. Our contribution lies in the ability of our model to handle
  these unexpected conditions: 1) when the human's intention is estimated
  to be irrelevant to the assigned task and may be unknown
  to the robot, e.g., motivation is lost, another assignment is received,
  onset of tiredness, and 2) when the human's intention is relevant
  but the human doesn't want the robot's assistance in the given
  context, e.g., because of the human's changing emotional states or
  the human's task-relevant distrust for the robot. Our results show
  that integrating this model into a robot's decision-making process
  increases the efficiency and naturalness of the collaboration."
