abstract: "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a family
  of directed search algorithms that has gained
  widespread attention in recent years, with its
  domain-independent nature making it particularly
  attractive to fields such as General Game Playing.
  Despite the vast amount of research into MCTS,
  the dynamics of the algorithm are still not yet
  fully understood. In particular, the effect of using
  knowledge-heavy or biased rollouts in MCTS
  still remains largely unknown, with surprising results
  demonstrating that better-informed rollouts do
  not necessarily result in stronger agents. We show
  that MCTS is well-suited to a class of domains possessing
  a smoothness property, and that any error
  due to incorrect bias is compounded in non-smooth
  domains, particularly for low-variance simulations."
