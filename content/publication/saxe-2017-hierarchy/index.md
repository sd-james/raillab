abstract: "Hierarchical architectures are critical to the
  scalability of reinforcement learning methods.
  Most current hierarchical frameworks execute actions
  serially, with macro-actions comprising sequences
  of primitive actions. We propose a novel
  alternative to these control hierarchies based on
  concurrent execution of many actions in parallel.
  Our scheme exploits the guaranteed concurrent
  compositionality provided by the linearly solvable
  Markov decision process (LMDP) framework,
  which naturally enables a learning agent to draw
  on several macro-actions simultaneously to solve
  new tasks. We introduce the Multitask LMDP
  module, which maintains a parallel distributed
  representation of tasks and may be stacked to form
  deep hierarchies abstracted in space and time."
