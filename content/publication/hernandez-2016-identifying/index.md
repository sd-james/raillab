abstract: "In many situations, agents are required to use a set
  of strategies (behaviors) and switch among them during
  the course of an interaction. This work focuses on
  the problem of recognizing the strategy used by an
  agent within a small number of interactions. We propose
  using a Bayesian framework to address this problem.
  Bayesian policy reuse (BPR) has been empirically
  shown to be efficient at correctly detecting the best policy
  to use from a library in sequential decision tasks.
  In this paper we extend BPR to adversarial settings,
  in particular, to opponents that switch from one stationary
  strategy to another. Our proposed extension enables
  learning new models in an online fashion when
  the learning agent detects that the current policies are
  not performing optimally. Experiments presented in repeated
  games show that our approach is capable of
  efficiently detecting opponent strategies and reacting
  quickly to behavior switches, thereby yielding better
  performance than state-of-the-art approaches in terms
  of average rewards."
