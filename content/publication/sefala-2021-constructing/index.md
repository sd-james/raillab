abstract: "Aerial images of neighborhoods in South Africa show the clear legacy of Apartheid, a former policy of political 
  and economic discrimination against non-European groups, with completely segregated neighborhoods of townships next 
  to gated wealthy areas. This paper introduces the first publicly available dataset to study the evolution of spatial 
  apartheid, using 6,768 high resolution satellite images of 9 provinces in South Africa. Our dataset was created 
  using polygons demarcating land use, geographically labelled coordinates of buildings in South Africa, and high resolution
  satellite imagery covering the country from 2006-2017. We describe our iterative process to create this dataset, which 
  includes pixel wise labels for 4 classes of neighborhoods: wealthy areas, non wealthy areas, non residential neighborhoods and vacant land.
  While datasets 7 times smaller than ours have cost over 1M to annotate, our dataset was created with highly constrained resources. 
  We finally show examples of applications examining the evolution of neighborhoods in South Africa using our dataset."
