abstract: "We present a framework for autonomously learning
  a portable symbolic representation that describes
  a collection of low-level continuous environments.
  We show that abstract representations
  can be learned in a task-independent space
  specific to the agent that, when combined with
  problem-specific information, can be used for
  planning. We demonstrate knowledge transfer
  in a video game domain where an agent learns
  portable, task-independent symbolic rules, and
  then learns instantiations of these rules on a per-task
  basis, reducing the number of samples required
  to learn a representation of a new task."
