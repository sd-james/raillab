abstract: "Constructing robust controllers to perform tasks in large, continually
  changing worlds is a difficult problem. A long-lived
  agent placed in such a world could be required to perform a
  variety of different tasks. For this to be possible, the agent
  needs to be able to abstract its experiences in a reusable way.
  This paper addresses the problem of online multitask decision
  making in such complex worlds, with inherent incompleteness
  in models of change. A fully general version of
  this problem is intractable but many interesting domains are
  rendered manageable by the fact that all instances of tasks
  may be described using a finite set of qualitatively meaningful
  contexts. We suggest an approach to solving the multitask
  problem through decomposing the domain into a set of capabilities
  based on these local contexts. Capabilities resemble
  the options of hierarchical reinforcement learning, but provide
  robust behaviours capable of achieving some subgoal
  with the associated guarantee of achieving at least a particular
  aspiration level of performance. This enables using these
  policies within a planning framework, and they become a
  level of abstraction which factorises an otherwise large domain
  into task-independent sub-problems, with well-defined
  interfaces between the perception, control and planning problems.
  This is demonstrated in a stochastic navigation example,
  where an agent reaches different goals in different world
  instances without relearning."
