abstract: "Combining reinforcement learning with language grounding is challenging as the agent needs to explore the
 environment while simultaneously learning multiple language-conditioned tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel 
 method: the compositionally-enabled reinforcement learning language agent (CERLLA). Our method reduces the sample 
 complexity of tasks specified with language by leveraging compositional policy representations and a semantic parser
 trained using reinforcement learning and in-context learning. We evaluate our approach in an environment 
 requiring function approximation and demonstrate compositional generalization to novel tasks. Our method 
 significantly outperforms the previous best non-compositional baseline in terms of sample complexity on 162 
 tasks designed to test compositional generalization. Our model attains a higher success rate and learns in 
 fewer steps than the non-compositional baseline. It reaches a success rate equal to an oracle policy's 
 upper-bound performance of 92%. With the same number of environment steps, the baseline only reaches a success 
 rate of 80%."
