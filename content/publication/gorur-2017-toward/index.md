abstract: "We propose an architecture that integrates
  Theory of Mind into a robot's decision-making to infer a human's
  intention and adapt to it. The architecture implements humanrobot
  collaborative decision-making for a robot incorporating
  human variability in their emotional and intentional states. This
  research first implements a mechanism for stochastically
  estimating a human's belief over the state of the actions that the
  human could possibly be executing. Then, we integrate this
  information into a novel stochastic human-robot shared planner
  that models the human's preferred plan. Our contribution lies in
  the ability of our model to handle the conditions: 1) when the
  human's intention is estimated incorrectly and the true intention
  may be unknown to the robot, and 2) when the human's intention
  is estimated correctly but the human doesn't want the robot's
  assistance in the given context. A robot integrating this model
  into its decision-making process would better understand a
  human's need for assistance and therefore adapt to behave less
  intrusively and more reasonably in assisting its human
  companion."
