abstract: "An important property for lifelong-learning
  agents is the ability to combine existing skills
  to solve new unseen tasks. In general, however,
  it is unclear how to compose existing skills in a
  principled manner. Under the assumption of deterministic
  dynamics, we prove that optimal value
  function composition can be achieved in entropy-regularised
  reinforcement learning (RL), and extend
  this result to the standard RL setting. Composition
  is demonstrated in a high-dimensional
  video game, where an agent with an existing library
  of skills is immediately able to solve new
  tasks without the need for further learning."
