abstract: We address the problem of efficiently learning high-level abstractions
  for task-level robot planning. Existing approaches require large amounts
  of data and fail to generalize learned abstractions to new environments. To address
  this, we propose to exploit the independence between spatial and non-spatial
  state variables in the preconditions of manipulation and navigation skills, mirroring
  the manipulation-navigation split in robotics research. Given a collection of
  portable manipulation abstractions (i.e., object-centric manipulation skills paired
  with matching symbolic representations), we derive an algorithm to automatically
  generate navigation abstractions that support mobile manipulation planning in a
  novel environment. We apply our approach to simulated data in AI2Thor and on
  real robot hardware with a coffee preparation task, efficiently generating plannable
  representations for mobile manipulators in just a few minutes of robot time, significantly
  outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
