abstract: We propose a method for autonomously learning an object-centric representation of a continuous and high-dimensional
  environment that is suitable for planning. Such representations can immediately be transferred between tasks that share
  the same types of objects, resulting in agents that require fewer samples to learn a model of a new task. 
  We first demonstrate our approach on a 2D crafting domain consisting of numerous objects where the agent learns a compact, 
  lifted representation that generalises across objects. We then apply it to a series of Minecraft tasks to learn
  object-centric representations and object types - directly from pixel data - that can be leveraged to solve new tasks quickly. 
  The resulting learned representations enable the use of a task-level planner, resulting in an agent capable of
  transferring learned representations to form complex, long-term plans.
