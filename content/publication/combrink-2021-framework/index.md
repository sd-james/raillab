abstract: Understanding which student support strategies mitigate dropout
  and improve student retention is an important part of modern higher
  educational research. One of the largest challenges institutions of higher
  learning currently face is the scalability of student support. Part of this
  is due to the shortage of staff addressing the needs of students, and
  the subsequent referral pathways associated to provide timeous student
  support strategies. This is further complicated by the difficulty of these
  referrals, especially as students are often faced with a combination of
  administrative, academic, social, and socio-economic challenges. A possible
  solution to this problem can be a combination of student outcome
  predictions and applying algorithmic recommender systems within the
  context of higher education. While much effort and detail has gone into
  the expansion of explaining algorithmic decision making in this context,
  there is still a need to develop data collection strategies Therefore, the
  purpose of this paper is to outline a data collection framework specific
  to recommender systems within this context in order to reduce collection
  biases, understand student characteristics, and find an ideal way to
  infer optimal influences on the student journey. If confirmation biases,
  challenges in data sparsity and the type of information to collect from
  students are not addressed, it will have detrimental effects on attempts to
  assess and evaluate the effects of these systems within higher education.
