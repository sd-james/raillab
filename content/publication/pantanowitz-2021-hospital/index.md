abstract: "Large hospitals sort patients into wards or clinics based on a number of factors. The information of a 
  patient's location is potentially useful in a number of medical contexts. By demonstrating and studying the 
  sorting that occurs in a hospital, we show that each ward has characteristic signatures emergent from the blood
  test results associated with patients in those wards. We further demonstrate the utility of this information to 
  fundamental research by evaluating the distribution of serum alanine aminotransferase, a liver enzyme hypothesised 
  to be linked to heart disease. We demonstrate the creation of classifiers to determine to which ward a patient is
  assigned with greater than 60 % accuracy within the first three prioritised predictions across 28 wards. This study
  is extended to predict patients' movements from intake wards through to destination wards as a proof-of-concept 
  into patient routing. We propose that this study provides a basis for leveraging metadata in a number of fields,
  including: fundamental research, laboratory medicine quality assurance, hospital and admissions management, and patient triage."
