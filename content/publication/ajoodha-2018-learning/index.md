abstract: "The recent widespread of availability of sensors, as part of the
  IoT, presents the opportunity to learn the properties of compound
  distributions in practical applications. Understanding
  temporal distributions by observations collected from the IoT
  can advance many intelligent applications. In this paper we
  develop an algorithm to learn influence between stochastic
  processes using observations obtained from the IoT. The proposed
  method learns these processes using temporal models
  independently, and then attempts to recover the underlying
  distribution of influence between them. Experimental
  results are provided which demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our method. This approach is useful in applications that require
  an understanding of how partially observed high-level
  processes can influence each other given a set of observations
  at different times."
