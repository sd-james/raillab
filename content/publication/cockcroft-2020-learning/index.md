abstract: "We present a method for learning options from
  segmented demonstration trajectories. The trajectories are first
  segmented into skills using nonparametric Bayesian clustering
  and a reward function for each segment is then learned using
  inverse reinforcement learning. From this, a set of inferred trajectories
  for the demonstration are generated. Option initiation sets
  and termination conditions are learned from these trajectories
  using the one-class support vector machine clustering algorithm.
  We demonstrate our method in the four rooms domain, where
  an agent is able to autonomously discover usable options from
  human demonstration. Our results show that these inferred
  options can then be used to improve learning and planning."
