abstract: "Exploration and self-directed learning are valuable
  components of early childhood development. This often comes
  at an unacceptable safety trade-off, as infants and toddlers
  are especially at risk from environmental hazards that may
  fundamentally limit their ability to interact with and explore
  their environments. In this work we address this risk through the
  incorporation of a caregiver robot, and present a model allowing
  it to autonomously adapt its environment to minimize danger
  for other (novice) agents in its vicinity. Through an approach
  focusing on action prediction strategies for agents with unknown
  goals, we create a model capable of using expert demonstrations
  to learn typical behaviors for a multitude of tasks. We then
  apply this model to predict likely agent behaviors and identify
  regions of risk within this action space. Our contribution uses this
  information to prioritize and execute risk mitigating behaviors,
  manipulating and adapting the environment to minimize the
  potential harm the novice is likely to encounter. We conclude with
  an evaluation using multiple agents of varying goal-directedness,
  comparing agentsâ€™ self-interested performance in scenarios with
  and without the assistance of a caregiver incorporating our
  model. Our experiments yield promising results, with assisted
  agents incurring less damage, interacting longer, and exploring
  their environments more completely than unassisted agents."
