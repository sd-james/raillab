abstract: "This paper addresses the problem of online decision
  making in continually changing and complex environments, with
  inherent incompleteness in models of change. A fully general
  version of this problem is intractable but many interesting
  domains are rendered manageable by the fact that all instances
  of a task can be generated from a finite set of qualitatively
  meaningful contexts. We present an approach to online decision
  making that exploits this decomposability in a two part procedure.
  In a task independent exploratory process, our algorithm running
  on an autonomous agent learns the set of structural landmark
  contexts which compose its domain, and reduces this set through
  the use of the symmetry structure of permutation groups. To
  each reduced landmark we then associate a set of policies
  independent of global context. This enables an efficient online
  policy instantiation process that composes from already learnt
  policy templates. This is illustrated on a spatial navigation domain
  where the learning agent is shown to be able to play a pursuit-evasion
  game in random environments with unknown dynamic
  obstacles."
