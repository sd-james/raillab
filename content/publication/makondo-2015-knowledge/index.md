abstract: "Learning of robot kinematic and dynamic models
  from data has attracted much interest recently as an alternative
  to manually defined models. However, the amount of data
  required to learn these models becomes large when the number
  of degrees of freedom increases and collecting it can be a time-intensive
  process. We employ transfer learning techniques in
  order to speed up learning of robot models, by using additional
  data obtained from other robots. We propose a method for
  approximating non-linear mappings between manifolds, which
  we call Local Procrustes Analysis (LPA), by adopting and
  extending the linear Procrustes Analysis method. Experimental
  results indicate that the proposed method offers an accurate
  transfer of data and significantly improves learning of the
  forward kinematics model. Furthermore, it allows learning
  a global mapping between two robots that can be used to
  successfully transfer trajectories."
