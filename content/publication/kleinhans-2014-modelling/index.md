abstract: "The neural circuits that control grasping and perform related
  visual processing have been studied extensively in macaque monkeys. We
  are developing a computational model of this system, in order to better
  understand its function, and to explore applications to robotics. We
  recently modelled the neural representation of three-dimensional object
  shapes, and are currently extending the model to produce hand postures
  so that it can be tested on a robot. To train the extended model, we are
  developing a large database of object shapes and corresponding feasible
  grasps. Finally, further extensions are needed to account for the influence of higher-level goals on hand posture.
  This is essential because often the same object must be grasped in different ways for different purposes.
  The present paper focuses on a method of incorporating such higher-level
  goals. A proof-of-concept exhibits several important behaviours, such as
  choosing from multiple approaches to the same goal. Finally, we discuss
  a neural representation of objects that supports fast searching for analogous objects."
