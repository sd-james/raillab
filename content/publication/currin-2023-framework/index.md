abstract: "Traditional top-down approaches for global health have historically failed to
  achieve social progress (Hoffman et al., 2015; Hoffman & RÃ¸ttingen, 2015). Recently,
  however, a more holistic, multi-level approach termed One Health (OH)
  (Osterhaus et al., 2020) is being adopted. Several sets of challenges have been
  identified for the implementation of OH (dos S. Ribeiro et al., 2019), including
  policy and funding, education and training, and multi-actor, multi-domain,
  and multi-level collaborations. These exist despite the increasing accessibility to
  knowledge and digital collaborative research tools through the internet. To address
  some of these challenges, we propose a general framework for grassroots
  community-based means of participatory research. Additionally, we present a
  specific roadmap to create a Machine Learning for Global Health community in
  Africa. The proposed framework aims to enable any small group of individuals
  with scarce resources to build and sustain an online community within approximately
  two years. We provide a discussion on the potential impact of the proposed
  framework for global health research collaborations."
