abstract: "Representation learning is a difficult and important
  problem for autonomous agents. This paper presents an approach
  to automatic feature selection for a long-lived learning agent,
  which tackles the trade-off between a sparse feature set which
  cannot represent stimuli of interest, and rich feature sets which
  increase the dimensionality of the space and thus the difficulty
  of the learning problem. We focus on a multitask reinforcement
  learning setting, where the agent is learning domain knowledge in
  the form of behavioural invariances as action distributions which
  are independent of task specifications. Examining the change in
  entropy that occurs in these distributions after marginalising
  features provides an indicator of the importance of each feature.
  Interleaving this with policy learning yields an algorithm for
  automatically selecting features during online operation. We
  present experimental results in a simulated mobile manipulation
  environment which demonstrates the benefit of our approach."
