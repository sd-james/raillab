abstract: "In many situations, agents are required to use a set of strategies
  (behaviors) and switch among them during the course of
  an interaction. This work focuses on the problem of recognizing
  the strategy used by an agent within a small number
  of interactions. We propose using a Bayesian framework
  to address this problem. In this paper we extend Bayesian
  Policy Reuse to adversarial settings where opponents switch
  from one stationary strategy to another. Our extension en-
  ables online learning of new models when the learning agent
  detects that the current policies are not performing optimally. 
  Experiments presented in repeated games show that
  our approach yields better performance than state-of-the-art
  approaches in terms of average rewards."
