abstract: "In this paper we use content-based features to
  perform automatic classification of music pieces into genres.
  We categorise these features into four groups: features extracted
  from the Fourier transformâ€™s magnitude spectrum, features
  designed to inform on tempo, pitch-related features, and
  chordal features.   We perform a novel and thorough exploration of classification
  performance for different feature representations, including the
  mean and standard deviation of its distribution, by a histogram
  of various bin sizes, and using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients.
  Finally, the paper uses information gain ranking to present a
  pruned feature vector used by six off-the-shelf classifiers. Logistic
  regression achieves the best performance with an 81% accuracy
  on 10 GTZAN genres."
