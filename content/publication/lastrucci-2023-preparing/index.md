abstract: "This paper introduces two multilingual government
  themed corpora in various South African
  languages. The corpora were collected by gathering
  the South African Government newspaper
  (Vuk'uzenzele), as well as South African government
  speeches (ZA-gov-multilingual), that
  are translated into all 11 South African official
  languages. The corpora can be used for a myriad
  of downstream NLP tasks. The corpora
  were created to allow researchers to study the
  language used in South African government
  publications, with a focus on understanding
  how South African government officials communicate
  with their constituents. In this paper we highlight the process of gathering,
  cleaning and making available the corpora.
  We create parallel sentence corpora for
  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks using
  Language-Agnostic Sentence Representations
  (LASER) embeddings. With these aligned sentences
  we then provide NMT benchmarks for
  9 indigenous languages by fine-tuning a massively
  multilingual pre-trained language model"
