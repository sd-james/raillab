abstract: "Applying reinforcement learning to robotic systems poses a number of challenging problems. A key requirement 
  is the ability to handle continuous state and action spaces while remaining within a limited time and resource budget.
  Additionally, for safe operation, the system must make robust decisions under hard constraints. To address these challenges,
  we propose a model based approach that combines Gaussian Process regression and Receding Horizon Control. Using sparse spectrum 
  Gaussian Processes, we extend previous work by updating the dynamics model incrementally from a stream of sensory data. This 
  results in an agent that can learn and plan in real-time under non-linear constraints. We test our approach on a cart pole 
  swing-up environment and demonstrate the benefits of online learning on an autonomous racing task. The environment's dynamics
  are learned from limited training data and can be reused in new task instances without retraining."
