abstract: "Robots are increasingly being used in the industry. Businesses that use robots can produce products and provide
  services at lower costs and with higher quality. Some industries, like automotive manufacturing, have become dependent
  on robots. The impact of robots on society and the greater economy is not clear. Robots threaten the jobs of 
  low-skilled workers and even middle-skilled workers. While researchers and governments are trying to understand the
  impact of robots on the economy, it is commonly accepted that robots will be used more widely across all industries.
  With this in mind, it is useful to consider the current research in robotics at South African research institutions. 
  This paper is such a review. It is not exhaustive, but it provides a sense of the robotics research being done in 
  South African research institutions. It appears that research institutions do not work on common themes, yet many 
  research groups relate their work to Industry 4.0. The review suggests that each research group is working on topics 
  of interest to them. The implication of this is that a wide variety of robotic themes are being
  researched in South Africa."
