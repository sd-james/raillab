abstract: "Current structure learning practices in Bayesian
  networks have been developed to learn the structure between
  observable variables and learning latent parameters independently.
  One exception establishes a variant of EM for learning
  the structure of Bayesian networks in the presence of incomplete
  data. However, no method has demonstrated learning the
  influence structure between latent variables that describe (or are
  learned from) a number of observations. We present a method
  that learns a set of na¨ıve Bayes models (NBMs) independently
  given a partitioned set of observations, and then attempts to
  track the high-level influence structure between every NBM. The
  latent parameters of each model are then relearned to fine-tune
  the influence distribution between models for density estimation
  of new observations. Experimental results are provided which
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our non-parametric method.
  Applications of this method include knowledge discovery and
  density estimation in situations where we do not fully observe
  characteristics of the environment."
