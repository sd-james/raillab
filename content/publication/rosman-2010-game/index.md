abstract: "This paper addresses the problem of acquiring
  a hierarchically structured robotic skill in a non-stationary
  environment. This is achieved through a combination of learning
  primitive strategies from observation of an expert, and
  autonomously synthesising composite strategies from that basis.
  Both aspects of this problem are approached from a game
  theoretic viewpoint, building on prior work in the area of
  multiplicative weights learning algorithms. The utility of this
  procedure is demonstrated through simulation experiments
  motivated by the problem of autonomous driving. We show
  that this procedure allows the agent to come to terms with two
  forms of uncertainty in the world â€“ continually varying goals
  (due to oncoming traffic) and non-stationarity of optimisation
  criteria (e.g., driven by changing navigability of the road). We
  argue that this type of factored task specification and learning
  is a necessary ingredient for robust autonomous behaviour in
  a large-world setting."
