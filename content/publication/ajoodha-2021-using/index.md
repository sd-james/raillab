abstract: Numerous fields of science have investigated stochastic
  processes which are partially observable. However, the discovery
  and analysis of the interaction between, and the influence
  upon each other, of several of these processes, have not
  been probed extensively. This paper uses probabilistic structure
  learning in an attempt to learn influence relationships between
  stochastic processes that are partially observed. These processes
  are represented by hierarchical dynamic Bayesian networks (HDBNs).
  To track the direct influence between the these processes,
  we provide an algorithm that extends the BIC structure score
  as well as the cumbersome (greedy hill-climbing) local search
  procedure. Our method leverages the temporal nature of the
  HDBN through the use of assembles thereby surpassing the
  standard approach that treats each process as a single variable.
  The derived BIC-score for HDBN families is clearly shown to be
  theoretically decomposable and empirically consistent.
