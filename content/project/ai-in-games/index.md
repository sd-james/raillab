Our research project explores the application of AI and machine learning techniques in video games, focusing on procedural 
content generation and AI-driven advice. We aim to dynamically generate diverse game content and create intelligent virtual 
companions that offer personalised guidance and strategies to enhance player experiences. 
By integrating AI technologies, we strive to revolutionise video game design and contribute to the advancement of AI in the gaming industry.
