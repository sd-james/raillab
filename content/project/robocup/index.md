Our group competes in the RoboCupSoccer 3D Simulation, in which a team of 11 simulated Nau robots compete in a game of football against other teams from around the world. Our focus here is both on improving the low-level control of individual robots and incorporating high-level, multi-agent decision making into the team's strategy.
